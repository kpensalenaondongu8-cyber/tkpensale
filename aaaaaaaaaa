prompt for studying.

I currently came to the understanding that every block of code can be unique and have it particular signature and having AI do it for you exposes the uniqueness. So i want to go on a study section with you been the tutor. Explain in simple terms each line of code, also generating a pseudocode that could help simplify it for me. Explaining the functions, keywords, operators and other necessary information that are in the program and how i could possibly rewrite it to achieve the same result.
